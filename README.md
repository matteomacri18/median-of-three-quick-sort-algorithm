Implementation Median of three quick sort Algorithm - from Steven S. Skenia - The algorithm design manual book

Experiment where to implementation  Median of three quick sort by measuring the running time experimental for inputs of increasing length, with multiple repetitions for
the same length. </br>

QuickSort, it is universally considered the most efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm chooses the median
median of three elements of the array is sufficient to have partitions
generally balanced.
